**PROJECT NAME: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING-BASED APPROACH FOR ADAPTIVE RELEASE PLANNING**


**Overview:**
This system is designed to recommend features for software releases and plan their strategic implementation based on historical data, reinforcement learning, and recommendation algorithms.

**Description:**
The system utilizes various techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and reinforcement learning to recommend features for software releases. It also assists in strategically planning the rollout of these features across different releases.

**Features:**

**Content-Based Filtering:**
Uses natural language descriptions of features to recommend based on similarity.
Factors in textual familiarity, length, and complexity of feature descriptions.

**Collaborative Filtering:**
Recommends features based on historical user behavior and preferences.
Considers user interactions with similar features in the past.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL):**
Utilizes RL techniques to predict and strategize feature releases.
Considers textual complexity, familiarity, and repetition for decision-making.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
Measures system performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and coverage.
Compares against baseline models (e.g., global popularity, content-based, collaborative filtering).

**Release Planning:**
Prioritizes features based on importance scores, user impact, complexity, and dependencies.
Segments features into different software releases based on their prioritization.


**How to Use:**

**Data Preparation:**
Provide historical data of features, including descriptions, importance scores, and user interactions.

**Implementation:**
Use the provided Python code for implementing content-based, collaborative filtering, and reinforcement learning.
Evaluate the recommendation system using evaluation metrics and compare against baseline models.

**Strategic Release Planning:**
Use the feature prioritization algorithm to determine which features should go into which release.

**Metrics Evaluation:**
Execute code to evaluate system performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and coverage metrics.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.8.3

Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
